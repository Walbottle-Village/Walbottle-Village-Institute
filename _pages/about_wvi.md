			<h2><strong>About Walbottle Village Institute</strong></h2>
			<p>Walbottle Village Institute has sat in a prime location overlooking the village green since 1891 when it was first opened as a church mission room. A quaint little building which still in regular use today. The hall is managed by a team of volunteer trustees and members of the residents association. The hall is well used by a variety of clubs and groups during the week, details of which can be found on the <a href="wvi_events_calendar.html" title="visit the events calendar page" target="_self"><strong>events calendar page</strong></a> and the notice board outside the hall.</p>
