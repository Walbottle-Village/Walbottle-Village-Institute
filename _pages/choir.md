					<p><strong>The Walbottle Village choir formed in March 2022 is made up of a collection of local residents that simply like to sing.</strong></p>
					<p>Less of a choir and more a posh karaoke that sings their hearts out with like minded, friendly people. We meet every Monday from 7:30pm excluding bank hoidays. It's a great way to start your week and no singing talent required. Just turn up, we'd love to make you welcome and feel part of the group.</p>
					<p>Itâ€™s &pound;2 per week and the first session is free. All proceeds go to charities decided by the group. Over &pound;1000 will have been donated by the end of 2023.</p>
					<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Meeting every Monday excluding bank holidays <br><strong>Time:</strong> 7:30pm <br><strong>Venue:</strong> Walbottle Village Institute</p>
					<p>If you would like to join, just turn up on Monday or contact one of the group at <a href="mailto:enquiries@walbottletra.gmail.com" title="email Walbottle Village Tenants and Residents Association">enquiries@walbottletra.gmail.com</a></p>
