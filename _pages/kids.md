					<h3>The Romans In Newcastle upon Tyne</h3>
			  		<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
			  		<p>That the Roman Emperor called Hadrian visited Newcastle Upon Tyne in 122 AD.  He brought with him over 1000 soldiers and advisors. Of course it wasn’t called Newcastle Upon Tyne back then it had the funny name Pons Aelius. Pons meaning Bridge and Aelius was the family name of Emperor Hadrian like Smith or Jones. So Newcastle use to be called Hadrian’s Bridge.</p>
					<p><strong>But why did Emperor Hadrian visit Newcastle?</strong></p>
					<p>It is a very long way from Rome, especially on horse back.  Well the Roman Empire was having a lot of problems with the tribes in the North and Hadrian decided to build a big wall from Wallsend in the East right across the country to Bowness on Solway in the West.</p>
					<p>It would be 80 miles long and take 6 years and about 15,000 men to build.  The Wall was defended by Roman soldiers who stopped the Northern tribes (which the Romans called Barbarians) from attacking the civilised South. The Barbarians use to paint themselves with a blue paint called Wode before a battle to make themselves look more fierce.</p>
			 	 <p>2022 was the 1900th anniversary of the wall being built and to celebrate there were lots of activities across the country.</p>
